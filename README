This is a clone of the Dream Multimedia lib dreamdvd librarry
The library forms an interface/api between libdvdread and the enigma2
dvd handling code.

This clone is made as I made a lot of changes and have no write
access to the original repository. And because the server for the
original repo does not always seem to be online I decided to make
clone on github.

The changes mainly optimize menu handling and subtitle display.
The issue is that menu buttons are often displayed way to often
and somtimes do not appear or seem to dispaly repeatedline giving a
stroboscope effect. Sometimes subtitles are displayed to early. The
reaseon for most of this is that audio/video handling is handled by
hardware that uses /caching/buffers capuing delays. Menus and subtitles
are on OSD which is taken care of by the libdreamdvd libray itself.

Also the 'resume' function does not work.

Finally many cosmet changes, small bug fixes and refactored code
to remove duplicat code.

The current status is
- resume function works again
- menu buttons have less stroboscope effect and now always
  show correctly (99%)  but still are shown to soon sometimes.
- subtitle still may be displayed to soon.

I have  code that fixes mostly syunchronize buttons/subtiles with the
video output but it still fails sometimes  or result in problems displaying
the wrong vidoe data when navigating through menus.
