This is a fork of the Dream Multimedia lib dreamdvd library
The library forms an interface/api between libdvdread/libdvdnav
and the enigma2 dvd handling code.

This fork is made as I made a lot of changes and have no write
access to the original repository. And because the server for the
original repo does not always seem to be online I decided to make
clone on github.

The changes mainly optimize menu handling and subtitle display.
The issue is that menu buttons are often displayed way to often
and sometimes do not appear or seem to display repeatedly giving a
stroboscope effect. Sometimes subtitles are displayed to early. The
reaseon for most of this is that audio/video handling is handled by
hardware that uses caching/buffers creating delays. Menus and subtitles
are on OSD which is taken care of by the libdreamdvd libray itself.
Synchronizing OSD display with the hardware delays is a hassle...

Also the 'resume' function did not work.

Finally many cosmetic changes, small bug fixes and refactored code
to remove duplicate code and make things more clear.

The current status is
- resume function works again
- menu buttons have less stroboscope effect and now always
  show correctly (99%) but still are shown to soon sometimes.
- subtitle still may be displayed to soon.

I have code that mostly fixes buttons/subtitle sync with the
video output but it still fails sometimes or result in problems
displaying the wrong video data when navigating through menus.

So... usable but work in progress
